Hello!

I am George (he/she) and I'm running to be your undergraduate philosophy Academic Rep. 

Philosophy students are scarce in number, and divided between Colleges and specialisations. Without a clear and formal system of support from the Faculty, studying philosophy at Cambridge can at times feel confusing and alienating. Together, I hope to create a system of student support that **works for you**.

## Campaign Goals

If elected, I will pursue the following key policy objectives:

### Assessments

* Seek student input on changes to the **assessment format** (e.g. **typewritten essays**, **take-home essays**, or **open-book** examinations), with a view to balancing access needs and assessment outcomes. 

* Improve **transparency** in the assessment system by demanding more detailed **marking rubrics** and **examiner reports**, and a greater range of **sample answers**.

* Work with Faculty members to **minimise** the impacts of any marking and assessment boycotts on students.

### Teaching

* Implement a **feedback system for supervisions** to improve and standardise the quality of supervisions across Colleges.

* Advocate for greater **consistency and alignment** between content covered in lectures and content tested in assessments.

* Consult students on adding **new Tripos papers** to reflect student interest (e.g. papers on non-Western Philosophy, more options for Continental philosophy, a second-year Logic paper, etc.)

### Student Collaboration

* Create a platform for higher-year students to **share revision notes** with lower-year students (if they wish), and for these notes to be preserved for future generations.
* Reach out to **alumni** of the Philosophy Tripos who might **share advice and opportunities** for internships, careers, and graduate programmes.
* Organise informal discussion groups, revision groups, peer-support networks, and generally **platforms for students to collaborate**.

## Relevant Experience

During my two years of mandatory military service, I **co-founded and headed a council representing the interests of enlistees** in my unit to commanders. During my tenure, we successfully advocated for and implemented policies that led to a tangible improvement in enlistee welfare, and ensured that the voices of other enlistees were heard by their commanders. I also gained experience in **challenging and holding accountable** those in positions of authority.

My role as a policy analyst during military service equipped me with a range of skills, from policy drafting to minutes writing. I also learnt to balance the interests of a variety of stakeholders to ensure that policies bring the greatest good to the greatest number. I hope to use these skills for the betterment of fellow philosophy students.
